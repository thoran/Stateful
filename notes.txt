Things under consideration

20140612:
* json injectable state machine definitions (so as to enable reprogramming of state machines on the fly)
* multiple sets of states per class (need to be able to define multiple differently named stateful_state blocks)
* before and after hooks

20150117:
* print out state machine diagramme
* keep record of the most recent past state and then implement a state_changed? method (This is so as to enable raising of errors if an attempt to change to an improper state is attempted.)
